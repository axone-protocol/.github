## ðŸ”— The protocol

`Axone` is built on the [Cosmos SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk) ðŸ’« & [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/) consensus, and allows companies & individuals to define on-chain rules, share any off-chain resources & create a new generation of applications on top of them. With Axone, share anything digital, on your own terms
ðŸš€ solves the trust issue related to digital resource sharing
ðŸš€ sovereign, scalable, multichain & fully customizable (built on Cosmos, leveraging IBC, ICQ & ICA)
ðŸš€ unlocking real-world value creation, bridging the gap between web2 & web3.

After 4+ years of strategy, research and development, Axone is almost ready to become the foundation for a scalable Open Dataverse, unlocking a new wave of use cases through real-world decentralized coordination. Our team & community is building a set of tools at the infrastructure, protocol, data and application layers with UX, interoperability, privacy and security in mind, ready to ignite innovation through data sharing.
