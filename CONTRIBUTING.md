# Contributing

👐 As we build [Axone](https://axone.xyz) on open source projects, we do our best to make quality code available for the community.

🙋 So you want to contribute? Great. We appreciate any help you're willing to give. There's various ways to involved. It can be by testing or reviewing and opening issues or by submitting pull requests.

🏭 A few repositories are at the core of our protocol but we are developing a lot of tools, modules and services gravitating around these core projects. There's a diversity of technologies involved, surely you can find something you interested in. Start browsing for projects [here](https://github.com/orgs/axone-protocol/repositories).

🧐 Remember that some projects are mainly designed for [Axone](https://github.com/axone-protocol) needs. This is why we may have to refuse change requests simply because they do not comply with our internal requirements, and not because they are not relevant.
